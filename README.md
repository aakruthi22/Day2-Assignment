1)pgm1.c:-
      Recursive Factorial Calculation`  
   `Scenario:`  
   A `mathematics research lab` needs a program 
    to calculate the `factorial of a number` using recursion.  

  `Input Example:`  
  ```
  Enter a number: 5
  ```

  `Output Example:`  
  ```
  Factorial of 5 is 120
  ```
2)pgm2.c:-
     Student Database Using Pointers`  
    `Scenario:`  
    A college maintains student records using pointers. The program should:  
   - Store `Student Name` and `Marks`  
   - Print all student details  

   Use `pointers` to allocate memory dynamically.

  `Input Example:`  
  ```
  Enter number of students: 2
  Enter Student 1 Name: Alice
 Enter Marks: 85
  Enter Student 2 Name: Bob
  Enter Marks: 90
  ```

  `Output Example:`  
  ```
  Student Records:
  Alice - 85
 Bob - 90
 ```
3)pgm3.c:-
    E-commerce Discount Calculation`  
   `Scenario:`  
   An e-commerce website provides `discounts`:  
   - `10% discount` if the bill is between ₹500 and ₹1000  
  - `20% discount` if the bill is above ₹1000  
  - No discount otherwise  

Write a function to `calculate the final payable amount`.

`Input Example:`  
```
Enter total bill amount: ₹1200
```

`Output Example:`  
```
Final Payable Amount: ₹960 (after 20% discount)
```
